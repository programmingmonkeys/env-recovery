# Environment Recovery

After experiencing a work laptop replacement and having to replace a motherboard on a personal Mac I realized how much of a pain point it was to replicate the environment I had worked so hard to build. This repository is a listing of helpers for anyone that wants to mirror their environment and the goal is to eventually build this as a node module. Any additional helpers are welcome.

## Instructions

Go to the directory and follow the instructions.

## Requirements

currently this has only been tested for Mac running macOS Mojave
